## Documentation

**Project Description:** In this project I've tried to build an Employee Management System, which will keep all the employee details of an organization.
The Basic CRUD operation has performed in order to make this project functional, which are Create, Read, Update and Delete any record.

**Back-end Task:** I've chosen ASP.NET Core 6 backend framework to build and generate the REST API which are POST(create), GET(read), PUT(update) and DELETE(delete) by communicating with the database.
The API of this project follow the RESTful Web Service and HTTP Protocol and documented with the help of Swagger API Documentation Support.
For Database table creation and data migration, I used Entity Framework Core ORM Tool, And Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio is used for Database Management purpose.

**Front-end Task:** To visualize content on client side (in browser) I've used, component-based front-end framework ANGULAR_14. 
Specific Components and webpages are created with HTML, Bootstrap and CSS.
